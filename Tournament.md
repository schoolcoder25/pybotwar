# Introduction #

A Tournament is a series of battles run with the same set of robots. Due to randomized initial conditions, robots will do better or worse even against the same opponents. With a long series of battles, the stronger robots should rise to the top.

For a possibly more accurate assessment of a robot's strength, see also SuperTournament.
